Intro

This is a supplementary instruction for the paper "Enforcement of Time-Constrained GMECs on Time-Colored Petri Nets".

This supplementary file includes the nomenclature and additional data for the port system case study presented in Section VI of the paper.

Specifically, due to the space limitation, the parameterized modified state class graph generated by the time-colored Petri net (shown in Fig. 4 of the paper) is presented in tabular form by Tables I, II, and III of the supplementary file. In addition, we enumerate all initial-to-terminal paths derived from the parameterized modified state class graph to illustrate how transition sequences unfold along these paths.
